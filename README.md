# Lumerin Spot Marketplace Monorepo

Shared home for the Lumerin spot hashpower marketplace: Solidity contracts, a React UI, indexing pipeline, and docs. Each project ships with its own README for setup and day‑to‑day commands—start there for details.

## Repository layout

- `contracts/` — Marketplace smart contracts, deployment scripts, and bindings tooling. See [`contracts/README.md`](contracts/README.md).
- `ui/` — React-based frontend for buying, selling, and managing spot hashpower. See [`ui/README.md`](ui/README.md).
- `indexer/` — Subgraph/indexer configuration and tests (currently minimal). See [`indexer/README.md`](indexer/README.md).
- `docs/` — Placeholder for GitBook-synced documentation. See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

## Documentation and support

- Architecture and usage notes will live under `docs/` (GitBook sync). For now, rely on the project READMEs above.
- License: MIT ([`LICENSE`](LICENSE) at repo root).
